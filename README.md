## How to Play

1. **Objective:**
   - The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - The game is played between two players, alternating turns.
   - On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their current turn's score.

3. **Rolling a 1:**
   - If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in their current turn, and it's the next player's turn.

4. **Hold:**
   - The player can choose to hold (end their turn) at any time. When a player holds, their current turn's score is added to their total score, and it's the next player's turn.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to reach or exceed 100 points on their total score wins the game.

6. **New Game:**
   - Players can click the "New Game" button to reset the scores and start a new game.
